**Subject:** "But I Don't Have Time for AI" (Here's Why You Can't Afford Not To)

**Content:**
```
Hi [FIRST_NAME],

I understand the concern about time. But here's the truth:

The time you spend NOT implementing AI is costing you more than the time it takes to implement it.

Consider this:
• 1 hour of AI setup saves 10 hours per week
• 1 day of training saves 5 days per month
• 1 week of implementation saves 4 weeks per quarter

The ROI is immediate and exponential.
